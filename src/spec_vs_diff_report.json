  "summary": "The diff does not add the required generated PNG sticker assets or any frontend/public assets. Instead, it modifies backend canister code and project metadata, and updates a frontend file summary document—changes that are unrelated to the requested sticker PNG generation and static asset hosting.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Generate 3 separate vintage-style price tag sticker images as transparent-background PNGs (512x512) with subtle paper texture and a small peeled corner; text must be exactly MINT (green), NEAR MINT (blue), PLAYED (orange).",
      "reason": "No PNG assets are added in the diff (Added files: none), and there is no evidence of image generation output files or any changes under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
