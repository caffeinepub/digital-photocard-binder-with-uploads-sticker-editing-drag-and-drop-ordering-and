  "summary": "The implementation appears to cover most requirements comprehensively. The Master Admin Key is stored in backend state, the admin portal includes verification with inactivity timeout, a User Oversight Table with filtering and read-only binder viewing is implemented, and dynamic grid layouts with admin-managed presets are in place. However, some requirements have incomplete or missing evidence in the truncated diff.",

      "requirement": "Total Cards Collected aggregates all cards across all binders for each user",
      "reason": "The backend main.mo is truncated before the getAllUsers implementation is visible, so the aggregation logic for total cards cannot be verified from the diff",
